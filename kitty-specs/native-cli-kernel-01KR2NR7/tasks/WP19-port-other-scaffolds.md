# WP19 — Port: Other scaffolds

## Branch Strategy

`main` → `main` per lanes.json.

## Subtasks

### T085 — Port `RelationshipTypeScaffoldCommand` → `RelationshipTypeScaffoldHandler`
### T086 — Port `WorkflowScaffoldCommand` → `WorkflowScaffoldHandler`
### T087 — Port `ExtensionScaffoldCommand` → `ExtensionScaffoldHandler`
### T088 — Port `ScaffoldAuthCommand` → `ScaffoldAuthHandler`

Apply canonical port pattern (see WP06). Note `ScaffoldAuthCommandTest.php` lives at `tests/Unit/ScaffoldAuthCommandTest.php` (top-level), not under `tests/Unit/Command/` — the ownership glob covers both.

### T088-bonus — `OtherScaffoldsServiceProvider`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Four legacy commands deleted, four handlers created.
- [ ] Provider registered.
- [ ] Tests + snapshot tests pass.
- [ ] Full suite green.

## Implementation command

```bash
spec-kitty agent action implement WP19 --agent <name>
```
